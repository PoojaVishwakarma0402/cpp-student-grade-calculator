# C++ Student Grade Calculator

A simple C++ program that calculates the average grade of students based on their subject marks.

## Usage

This program allows you to input subject marks for six different students and then calculates the average grade for each student.

- It defines a `Student` class, with each `Student` having an array of four subject marks.
- You will be prompted to enter the marks for each subject for each of the six students.
- After entering the marks, the program calculates the average for each student and displays the results.
